          Since 2017, our company has begun the production of inflatable boats
          using a new technology for the French company GOLD BAITS. Now we are
          pleased to offer these boats for the native Ukrainian market under the
          name CARP CERIES. The main difference between these boats and all the
          others presented on the Ukrainian market is the combined seam
          technology. (you can read more about the seams used for the
          manufacture of boats in the article ... .. link to the article about
          the seams ...
        </p>

        <article class="our-prodacts-article">
          The difference between this seam and other manufacturers is the
          presence of a soldered high-density tape. This is not just a strip of
          the material from which the boat is made, but a special strip for
          soldering, and is already closed on top with a strip of material. This
          not only ensured absolute tightness and strength of the connection,
          but also made it possible to use materials that are not available to
          other manufacturers. More elastic and durable, these materials are not
          only very hard to tear, they are even difficult to scratch. The boats
          of this series are made of Finnish fabric with a density of 1100 g/m2
          (FISHER sub-series) or from German Valmex with a density of 1200 g/m2
          (PRO sub-series). Also the lower part of the boat is protected by a
          120mm PVC profile.
